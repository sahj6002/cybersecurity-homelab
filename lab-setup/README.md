# Cybersecurity Home Lab

## Overview  
This is my personal cybersecurity home lab built using VirtualBox and Kali Linux. It’s where I experiment, practice ethical hacking, and learn about networks and systems.

---

## Setup  
- Host OS: Windows 11  
- Virtual Machine: Kali Linux 2025.1a (running on VirtualBox)  
- RAM: 3GB  
- CPU: 2 cores  

---

## What I Followed  
- Kali installation tutorial (YouTube)  
- Initial network configuration  
- VM settings for 64-bit OS  

---

## What I’m Planning to Learn Here  
- Wireshark for packet analysis  
- Nmap for network scanning  
- Deauthentication simulation (later)  
- Practice CTFs locally  

---

## Reflection  
I followed a tutorial to get started, but I’m turning this into a real learning space to build practical cybersecurity skills.

---

## Notes  
- I’ll add screenshots and learnings as I go  
- Eventually will integrate Metasploitable and defensive tools
